# Workshops in R

## April 26, 2016 - Emergent: intermediate R

Emergent's first R workshop focussed on the basics of R, such as data structure, descriptive statistics and simple plots. In this follow-up workshop, organized by DataCamp, we'll take things one step further. In a case study format, we'll go through the typical data analysis process, going from importing data to cleaning data over building models, to finally visualizing and reporting your findings. Instead of focusing on the traditional techniques for these different steps in the processing, state-of-the-art R packages will be introduced that make your analysis easier, better and faster. After this workshop, you will be able to start your own basic analyses in R, from scratch. If you could not attend the previous R workshop, you can catch up by taking DataCamp's free intro to R course: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r.
