## Case study

Typical steps of an analysis in R:

- Import
- Explore
- Model
- Visualize
- Report

## Import

Using the `fread()` function from the `data.table` package.

```{r import}
library(data.table)
bank <- fread("~/courses/talk-r/cs_bank_marketing/bank-full.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
bank <- as.data.frame(bank)
```

## Explore

```{r explore}
head(bank)
str(bank)
summary(bank)

# make y have a more meaningful name.
names(bank)[ncol(bank)] <- "subscribed"

hist(bank$age)

library(ggvis)
library(dplyr)
bank %>% group_by(subscribed) %>% ggvis(~age, fill = ~subscribed) %>% layer_densities()
bank %>% ggvis(~education, fill = ~subscribed) %>% layer_bars()

bank %>% 
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarise(pct_yes = sum(subscribed == "yes")/n())
```

## Model

```{r model}
set.seed(123)
n <- nrow(bank)
bank_scrambled <- bank[sample(1:n),]
train <- bank_scrambled[1:floor(0.7*n),]
test <- bank_scrambled[(floor(0.7*n)+1):n,]

library(rpart)
tree <- rpart(subscribed ~ ., train, method = "class")
```

## Visualize

```{r viz}
library(rattle)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
fancyRpartPlot(tree)
```

Does this model generalize to unseen observations? Try out the model on a test set, that you haven't used to train your model.

```{r predict}
pred <- predict(tree, test, type = "class")

# build confusion matrix
conf <- table(test$subscribed, pred)

# calculate precision and recall
precision <- conf[1,1] / (conf[1,1] + conf[2,1])
precision
recall <- conf[1,1] / (conf[1,1] + conf[2,2])
recall
```

Back to the drawing board?
